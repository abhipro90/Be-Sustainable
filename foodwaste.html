<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We (Be Sustainable Staff) are a group of students who are the IB <br> (International Buccularate) school AICS. In IB, we need to do  <br> SASA or Service in Action and for our SASA we chose to analyse <br> food and plastic waste, in our own school. We then made photos of <br> food and plastic waste in our school(See What we do) made <br> infographics representing this data, this website one of them. <br><br>

We hope by making this website other student in IB schools take<br> inspiration from our idea. <br><br>

<h1>Food Waste</h1>
<p>Looking at just The Netherlands, billions worth of food is scorched away every year. While intermittently, around the world so many are dying of hunger. How can people feast and waste on food while people in poverty are starving? Because people who are not in financial troubles do it without even thinking about it. Consumers are the main source of food wastage. Excessive food is bought at the supermarket and then forgotten about once it is brought home. Then 1 by 1 food starts being wasted due to expiry and bringing too much to your plate. Each time you give yourself the satisfaction that it is not ‘that much’ but it piles up. Now that we see that so much food is wasted in the bins in our school and we found from research how bad it is to waste food, we are working to stop food waste.</p>
