<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We (Be Sustainable Staff) are a group of students who are the IB <br> (International Buccularate) school AICS. In IB, we need to do  <br> SASA or Service in Action and for our SASA we chose to analyse <br> food and plastic waste, in our own school. We then made photos of <br> food and plastic waste in our school(See What we do) made <br> infographics representing this data, this website one of them. <br><br>

We hope by making this website other student in IB schools take<br> inspiration from our idea. <br><br>

<h1>How we started?</h1>
<p>Me (Abhishek Pillai), Yuval Levi, Kevin Haver and Alec Lichiko of the School Aics found out that our school transitioned to become an EcoSchool. This meant we could contribute to the movement. We had an idea to add more bins in our school cafeteria for different types of waste. We also wanted to show people what the significance of it was. This is why we did an experiment in our school cafeteria bins to identify how much food and plastic was thrown away.  We found that in each of the 4 bins there was approximately 50% of waste. Given that 60L full bin bags are used that means 30L in each of the 4 bins daily. That is 120L in total daily. 43800L in a year from just our cafetaria!</p>
